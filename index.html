            <h2>Hi! I'm Lauren Davis</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer living in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
            <p>As a former musician and music teacher, I am amazed at the similarities between coding and music:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They both involve functions, loops, and abstract languages.</li>
                <li>They both require muscle memory and pattern memorization.</li>
                <li>There is so much room in both mediums for innovation, collaboration, and variety!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please take a look at my website and feel free to <a href="mailto:davislaurenmichelle@gmail.com">Contact Me!</a></p>

            <h3>About Lauren</h3>
            <p>I have been a classical musician my entire life. After graduating from music school, I performed, composed, and taught music for a living for 10 years. While I loved the work that I did, I felt that a career in music was not for me. Then I discoved coding and realized it was actually very similar to learning and composing music, but with <strong>much</strong> better career prospects :)</p>

            <p>After teaching myself some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics through free online resources, I decided I wanted a more structured learning process. I started looking into coding bootcamps and that's when I found <a href="https://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. I'm so thrilled to start my journey as a web developer, and I can't wait to work on projects and collaborate with other developers!</p>
